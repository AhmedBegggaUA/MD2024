# Graphs on real life

During the course we have seen many libraries and tools that can be used to create graphs. Additionally, we have seen how to navigate through the data and how to create a graph from it. Finally, the last couple of weeks we have seen how to explore the graph and how to extract information from it.

In this section, we will apply all the knowledge we have acquired to a real case. We will use the data from the library `PytorchGeometric` to create a graph and explore it. Do not worry if you are not familiar with the library, we will guide you through the process and also provide you with the necessary information and code to perform the tasks.

```{Note}

It is important to mention that the scope of this subject is not to teach you how different machine learning or deep learning models work, but to show you how to create a graph from a dataset and how to explore it. If you are interested in learning more about the models, we encourage you to visit the official documentation of the library or the official documentation of the model you are interested in.

## Pytorch Geometric

Pytorch Geometric is a library for deep learning on irregular input data such as graphs. It consists of various methods and utilities to process graphs and extract information from them. The library is built on top of Pytorch, which is a popular deep learning library. Pytorch Geometric provides a lot of tools to work with graphs, such as creating graphs, loading datasets, and applying different models to them.

Also PyG provides a lot of datasets that can be used to test the models in different tasks such as node classification, link prediction, graph classification, etc. In this section, we will use one of the datasets provided by PyG to create a graph and explore it.
